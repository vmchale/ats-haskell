# haskell-ats

This is a template for [pi](https://github.com/vmchale/project-init) that
initializes a new ATS project which will call Haskell code. You
can invoke it with:

```
 $ pi git vmchale/ats-haskell project/
```

You may wish to look at the [hs2ats](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs2ats)
package as well.
